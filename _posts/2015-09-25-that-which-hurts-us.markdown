Dear Martin,

I've thought of a parable.

_Two men in a room together. The first man gets bitten on his finger by a tick. The tick latches on. So the second man, having removed a tick prior by burning the tick, tells the first man this. The first man holds his finger above a candle as the second man exits the room. A few minutes later, the second man hears a blood-curdling scream and runs back into the room. The first man is screaming in pain which his finger now black and the skin melting. The tick is long gone. The second man asks the first, "Why is your finger still above the flame?" The first man replies, "You didn't tell me to remove it"._

This denotes the ignorance of man and the pain caused by following outdated ideals.

We do this when the two things that separate us from other animals (self-awareness and the aptitude for empathy) are absent.

In this case, that which hurts us does not make us stronger, but verifies our absent-mindedness and need for direction.

We should discuss further. But until then, I hope your are well.

Sincerly,
